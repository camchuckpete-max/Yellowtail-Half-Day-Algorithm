# Decisions

Numbered, append-only. Each entry: what, why, and what would change it.

## D-001 Label definition (2026-09-23)
Day D is **positive** if any per-boat half-day *fishing* trip (`1/2 Day AM`, `PM`,
`Twilight`, `1/2 Day`, `1/2 Day Trip`) from the San Diego landings, fished on D,
reports ≥1 yellowtail kept **or released**. Hoop-net/lobster half days are
excluded (not hook-and-line). Days with no half-day fishing trip reported are
**not evaluable** (no row), never counted as negatives.

## D-002 Landings
seaforth, fishermans, hm, point_loma. `oceanside` only appears in 2026 (3 rows);
including it would change the label definition mid-series. Revisit if its history is backfilled.

## D-003 Publication-time assumptions (landing counts)
The source only has the return date, not a post time, so the time a count
became public is assumed per trip class (`yt/events.py::PUBLISH_TIME`):
AM half-day 14:00, PM/unspecified half-day 19:00, 3/4-day 19:30, overnight 12:00
on return day. Twilight, hoop-net, full-day and 1.5-day+ trips: not visible until
00:00 the next day (return times too close to or after 21:00). This is the
**main** timing mode. `--strict` makes nothing from D-1 visible; any claimed win
must also be checked in strict mode.

## D-004 Baselines use the same information set
B1 "yesterday" = any yellowtail on D-1 among trips public at 21:00 D-1 (so D-1
twilight is not part of it). B2 = any half-day yellowtail on D-7..D-1 (visible).
Both baselines therefore have exactly the information the model has.

## D-005 Forecasts
`conditions_daily`, zone `t_sd_coast`, NWS forecast rows only, stamped with the
`issue_utc` in their `vintage`. Rows without a provable issue time are dropped.
Observed 2010–2015 issue times are ≈15:00 PT D-1 (latest 19:30), all before the cutoff.

## D-006 FishDope narrative excluded (for now)
FishDope daily reports are published ~21:00–22:30 PT on the report date (after
our cutoff for D-1's report), and 2010–2012 reports carry `updated_at` stamps
months later (e.g. a 2012-08-12 report updated 2013-08-26), so the text we have
is not provably what was public at the cutoff. Rule if re-admitted: report for
date R may be used for D only if R ≤ D-2 **and** its last-modified time ≤ the
D-1 21:00 cutoff. Under that rule only ≈mid-2013 onward is usable — too little
overlap with 2010–2015 landing data today. Revisit when more landing years load.

## D-007 Excluded tables
SST / chlorophyll / tides in `conditions_daily` start 2020+; NDBC buoys start 2022;
no overlap with current half-day history (2010-04 → 2015-06). Month-archive
`daily_aggregate` landing rows are excluded (whole-landing totals, and their
species_json concatenates several days — a source parsing bug, not ours to fix).

## D-008 Primary metric: MCC of the daily yes/no call
Classes are imbalanced (≈26% positive), so accuracy rewards always saying "no".
Matthews correlation coefficient is symmetric and imbalance-robust, and applies
to the baselines' hard calls. AUC/Brier/accuracy/precision/recall also reported.

## D-009 "Noticeably better" (Goal 1)
Pooled dev MCC ≥ best baseline MCC + 0.05 **and** the 95% moving-block bootstrap
(14-day blocks, 2000 reps) CI of MCC(model) − MCC(best baseline) lies above 0,
then confirmed on the holdout.

## D-010 Evaluation protocol
Dev folds = test years 2012, 2013, 2014 (2010–2011 are training-only so every fold
has ≥1 inner validation year). Training rows for a fold end ≥2 days before its
first test day. Holdout = all days ≥ 2015-01-01 (incl. 2026 days as they load).
Days are scored only if ≥5 of the previous 7 days had visible half-day reports
(PIT-computable data-completeness filter; removes 19 days, mostly isolated 2019–2026 days).
First 30 days of data are history only.

## D-011 Transform for linear models (debugging finding)
2014 had a bonito explosion: per-trip bonito reached ~400× its 2010–2013 maximum
and the logistic model extrapolated to p≈1e-15 (2014 fold AUC 0.18). Fix:
log1p all `*per_trip*` features and clip standardized inputs to ±4. Applied to all
logistic runs from iteration 1 on.

## D-012 Threshold rule is an experiment dimension
Inner-OOF MCC thresholds were unstable (2012 fold's only inner year, 2011, has a
6.7% base rate → threshold 0.98, zero calls). Fixed thresholds (0.5, 0.4) are run
as alternatives; the rule is part of each experiment's spec.

## D-013 Goal 3 definition
A breakout call = a "yes" on a day where no half-day yellowtail was visible for
D-7..D-1. Precision = hits / breakout calls. Success requires precision ≥ 0.40
with ≥10 calls in the evaluated period (fewer is anecdotal); the Wilson 95% lower
bound is reported alongside. Dev base rate among eligible days: 43/793 = 5.4%.

## D-014 Runs require committed code
`write_run` refuses to save from a dirty `yt/` or `tests/`. The first ten runs
(made before the first commit) are in `archive/iter0_uncommitted_code/` and are
re-run from committed code.

## D-015 Goal 3 breakout window changed to 3 days (user decision, 2026-09-23)
Supersedes the window in D-013. A breakout-eligible day is one with **no
half-day yellowtail visible in D-3..D-1** at the 21:00 D-1 cutoff (`hd_ytdays_3 == 0`).
Because D-1 twilight is not public at 21:00, the window in practice covers D-3 and
D-2 fully and D-1's AM/PM trips. Other D-013 criteria (precision ≥ 0.40, ≥10 calls,
Wilson lo95 reported) unchanged. Dev: 1041 eligible days, 72 positive (6.9%).
Runs logged before this change report breakouts under the 7-day window; they are
marked in LOG.md and all specs are re-run.

## D-016 Baseline B1 = most recent visible day
B1 is now "yellowtail on the most recent day that has any public half-day report"
(`hd_yt_lastday`). In main timing that is D-1 on 1605/1652 dev days (D-2 on 45,
D-3 on 2 when D-1 had no public AM/PM trip). Previously B1 was D-1 only, which
under `--strict` was always "no" (MCC 0, meaningless). The change can only make
the baseline equal or stronger; it differs from the old B1 on 8 dev days.

## D-017 Feature lists are frozen per spec
Specs reference explicit frozen lists (`_ALL_V1`, `_ALL_V2`, ...) rather than the
live `FEATURES`, so adding a feature never silently changes a spec that has run.

## D-018 Goals are worked strictly in order (user instruction, 2026-09-23)
Goal 2 starts only after Goal 1 is met (dev + holdout); Goal 3 only after Goal 2.
`e004_breakout_logreg` was run before this instruction and stays in the log as a
measurement only. Breakout statistics continue to be reported automatically in
every run's metrics, but no spec is tuned for Goal 3 until Goals 1–2 are done.

## D-019 Exploratory sweeps
Wide parameter sweeps (feature set × C × threshold) are run without saving full
run folders, to keep the repo small. Their complete stdout is committed under
`sweeps/` with the script that produced them, so every configuration that was
looked at is visible, not only the ones promoted to named specs. Promoting a
configuration to a spec after seeing its dev score is a form of selection on dev;
the holdout exists to catch that.
